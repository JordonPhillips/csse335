STATUS OF EACH PROBLEM:

PROBLEM 1 -> Working as expected
PROBLEM 2 -> Working as expected
PROBLEM 3 -> Working, though I don't have the conversion to MB/s quite right.
PROBLEM 4 -> Working as expected
PROBLEM 5 -> Not working, but close. I distribute the T params evenly and it
             seems that the shekel function is working correctly. However, I
             am not able to wait on all of the nodes to finish, for whatever
             reason, and so I don't get the correct value at the end.
